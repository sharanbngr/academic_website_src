# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors have detected ten binary-black hole (BBH) mergers in the first two observing runs, with many new candidate events in the ongoing third observing run. In addition to these events there exists a background of a much larger number of mergers which are not individually detectable. This background has generally been a target for cross-correlation based stochastic searches by LIGO and Virgo. The statistics of this ensemble of mergers encode much information of astrophysical and cosmological interest. A new method developed by Smith and Thrane using BBH parameter estimation promises to be much more sensitive to this background and its properties than cross-correlation methods. In this talk I will describe how this technique can be used to study the angular distribution of the binary black hole merger distribution in the sky. I will also describe a statistical formalism to combine the information from the binary black hole spatial distribution with electromagnetic tracers like galaxy counts, to study the structure of the universe at the scales simultaneously accessible to both probes."
