I am a PhD candidate in physics at the University of Minnesota working with [Prof. Vuk Mandic](http://groups.physics.umn.edu/ligo/). I am broadly interested in gravitational-wave physics, and data analysis methods for extracting astrophysical and cosmological information from them. I am a member of the [LIGO scientific collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) and the LISA consortium. 




Since my research mostly focuses on analysis of data, I am also interested in statistical methods - especially bayesian methods - and their applications to astrophysical problems.
